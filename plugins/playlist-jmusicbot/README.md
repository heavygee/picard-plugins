# Generate JMusicBot Playlist Plugin

Automatically generate playlists for JMusicBot when saving an album in MusicBrainz Picard. This plugin is designed to create `.txt` playlist files with Docker-friendly paths, ideal for use with JMusicBot, a popular Discord music bot that supports playlist files.

## Features

- Automatically generates a `.txt` playlist file when you save an album in Picard.
- Converts Windows file paths to Docker-friendly paths, making it easy to use your music with JMusicBot running in a Docker container.
- Playlist filenames use "slugged" versions of the artist and album names, making them URL-friendly and easy to manage.
- Configurable paths and playlist directory to suit different setups.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the `generate_jmusicbot_playlist` directory to the MusicBrainz Picard plugin directory:
   - **Windows**: `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\MusicBrainz\Picard\plugins\`
   - **Mac**: `~/Library/Preferences/MusicBrainz/Picard/plugins/`
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/MusicBrainz/Picard/plugins/`
3. Open MusicBrainz Picard.
4. Go to `Options` -> `Plugins`.
5. Enable the `Generate JMusicBot Playlist` plugin.

## Configuration

Before using the plugin, you need to configure the paths according to your environment:

1. Open MusicBrainz Picard.
2. Go to `Options` -> `Plugins`.
3. Select `Generate JMusicBot Playlist` and click on `Options...` or `Settings...`.
4. Configure the following paths:

   - **Windows Path 1**: The first base path on your system (e.g., `E:\Backups\Music`).
   - **Docker Path 1**: The corresponding Docker-friendly path (e.g., `/data/music`).
   - **Windows Path 2**: The second base path on your system (e.g., `E:\Music`).
   - **Docker Path 2**: The corresponding Docker-friendly path (e.g., `/data/cleaned/music`).
   - **Playlist Directory**: The directory where the playlists will be saved (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\docker\jmusicbot\Playlists\`).

## Usage

1. Load an album in MusicBrainz Picard.
2. Save the album.
3. The plugin will automatically generate a playlist file in the configured directory.
4. The playlist file will be named using slugged versions of the artist and album names (e.g., `artistname-albumname.txt`) and will contain the paths to the saved tracks, converted to Docker-friendly paths.

## Example

Suppose you have an album by "Richard Cheese" titled "Blue No Matter Who" saved in `E:\Backups\Music\AlbumName`. The plugin will create a playlist file named `richardcheese-bluenomatterwho.txt` in the configured playlist directory, with each track listed as `/data/music/AlbumName/TrackName.mp3`.
